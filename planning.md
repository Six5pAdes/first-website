    <h2>Who is iKON?
        <p>iKon is a South Korean boy band. Originally formed in 2015 by YG Entertainment, they are well-known for their
            hip-hop-inspired sound and image. They havve also garnered a reputation of being a "self-produced" group, in
            that they have been reponsible for writing and producing their own discography.</p>
    </h2>
    <h2>Members
        <p>There are currently six members. They include Jay (Kim Jin-hwan), Song (Song Yun-hyeong), Bobby (Kim Ji-won),
            DK (Kim Dong-hyuk), Ju-ne (Koo Jun-hoe), and Chan (Jung Chan-woo). There was originally a seventh member,
            B.I (Kim Han-bin), who also served as their leader and record producer; he voluntarily left in 2019
            following a drug scandal.
        </p>
    </h2>
    <h2>Brief History
        <p>The members of iKon initally competed on two survival shows: WIN: Who is Next, and Mix & Match, the latter
            show finalizing their lineup. They oficially debuted on September 2015 with the song "My Type," followed by
            an album titled "Welcome Back." In the coming years, their activities as a group were more sporadic, as they
            toured more than they released new music. In 2018, they released a second album titled "Return," which held
            the lead single "Love Scenario." This song cemented the group as a household name, beloved by people of
            all ages and earning them numerous awards at year-end ceremonies. However, their popularity came to a halt
            when B.I got caught in a drug scandal. He formally departed from the group and ended his contract with YG
            Entertainment, which put the rest of iKon in a sort of limbo status. Despite further releases, they could
            never fully recover. Eventually, iKon left the company following the completion of their own contracts in
            December 2022, subsequently signing with a new company known as 143 Entertainment; B.I, on the other hand,
            has recovered himself, becoming a relatively successful solo artist.</p>
